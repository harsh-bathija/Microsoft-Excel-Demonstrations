# MS-Excel-Demonstrations
This repository is to demonstrate some of the excel workbooks I have created.

The file "AMI Feasibility" shows a feasibility analysis for the installation of smart meters in a power company I worked at. The numbers, titles and other details have been changed to protect the privacy of the comapny.

The file "Inventory VBA" shows a VBA-enabled excel application I created for to manage the inventories of a trading firm.
